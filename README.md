# Quick Http Client
Quick HTTP Client is a Kotlin-based library that simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses. It is designed to offer a straightforward API for developers to perform network operations in their Android applications.

## Features
- Simple and concise API - Making HTTP requests is as simple as a few lines of code.
- HTTP Method Enum - Utilize the built-in RequestMethod enum for specifying HTTP methods with ease.
- SSL Pinning - Enhance security with integrated SSL Pinning, supporting both public key and certificate pinning.
- Retry Mechanism - Robust retry mechanism to handle intermittent network issues.
- Caching Strategy - Efficient response caching to reduce network load and speed up response time.
- Logging - Detailed logging to help with debugging and tracking network requests.

## Installation
To use the QuickHttpClient library in your project, add the following to your `settings.gradle` file
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
        // Other repositories
    }
}
```
Then, add the dependency to your module-level build.gradle file:
```groovy
implementation "com.github.thaer-al-khishen:quick-http-client:1.0.0-beta01"
```

## Initialization
Before using QuickHttpClient in your application, you need to initialize it within your `Application` class. This is a crucial step that should be done before making any network requests. Below is a sample initialization in the `MainApplication` class.

```kotlin
class MainApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        // Initialize QuickHttpClient
        QuickHttpClientConfig.initialize()
            // Uncomment and configure SSL pinning as needed
            /*
            .configureSSLPinning(
                SSLPinningMethod.PublicKeyPinning(
                    publicKeys = listOf(
                        "YOUR_DUMMY_PUBLIC_KEY_1",
                        "YOUR_DUMMY_PUBLIC_KEY_2"
                    )
                )
            )
            .configureSSLPinning(
                SSLPinningMethod.CertificatesPinning(
                    certificates = listOf(
                        "YOUR_DUMMY_CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT_1",
                        "YOUR_DUMMY_CERTIFICATE_FINGERPRINT_2"
                    )
                )
            )
            .configureHostNameVerification("your.domain.com")
            */
            // Add a request interceptor if needed
            .addRequestInterceptor(object : RequestInterceptor {
                override fun intercept(networkRequest: NetworkRequest?): RequestModifier {
                    networkRequest?.let {
                        Log.d("QuickHttpClientInterceptor", "Intercepting request: $it")
                    }
                    // Modify the request as needed
                    return RequestModifier()
                }
            })
            // Enable or disable logging
            .setLoggingCondition(true)
    }
}
```

## Usage
```kotlin
NetworkManager.makeNetworkCall<List<JsonPlaceHolderPost>>(
  NetworkRequest(
    endpoint = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts",
    requestMethod = RequestMethod.POST,
    body = makeRequestBody(
      JsonPlaceHolderPost(
        userId = 1,
        title = "Thaer",
        body = "Body",
        id = 1
      )
    ),
    params = listOf(
    QueryParameter("query", "getAll")
    ),
    headers = mutableListOf(RequestHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"))
  )
)
```
